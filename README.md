# Hardware Rooted Post-Quantum Identity Framework: A Non-Linear technique to secure Cloud Access control.
# The Problem:Why Cloud Security is Failing
1: The worst reason: why cloud security is fail that most security is only at the software level,And there are always "bugs" or "loopholes" in software.
2: Software Vulnerabilities: Software code is written by humans and is prone to bugs. Hackers can exploit bugs in the operating system or apps.
3: Identity & Access Management (IAM) Leaks: Most attacks occur because an employee's password is leaked or applications are stolen.Software cannot stop these "human errors".
4: Shared Resources (The "Neighbor" Problem): The cloud contains data from many companies on a single physical server.If the software is weak, data from one account can be "leaked" to another account (called side-channel attacks).
5: Lack of Hardware Root of Trust: The worst example is that when the server starts, it relies on software. If the software is already "Compromised" is, that security will never work.
# The Solution:
1: Hardware Lock: Our code simulates the logic that security is locked in the silicon (hardware), not in the software.Even if this hack is successful, the hacker will not be able to decrypt the encryption keys inside the chip.
2: Tamper-Proof: Hardware cannot be "re-engineered" as easily as software.
3: AI Monitoring:  Our backend code is doing this by "crashing" or "locking" the system as soon as it detects abnormal activity at the hardware level.
